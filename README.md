# Automerge Dependabot Github Action

This action automatically merges pull requests created by Dependabot with a set of configurable rules.

## Features

- Automatically merges eligible Dependabot pull requests
- Configurable minimum age for pull requests before automerging
- Blackout periods to prevent merging during specific times
- Filters for ignoring specific dependencies
- Filters for ignoring specific versions of dependencies
- Filter based on semantic versioning levels (major, minor, patch)

## Inputs

### `token`

**Required** The name of the environment variable that contains the GitHub token. Default: `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The token requires the following permissions:
- `contents: write` - To allow the merge operation to modify repository contents

Note: Using GITHUB_TOKEN will not trigger on.push events, recommend using a [github app token](https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token). See example below.

### `minimum-age-of-pr`

The minimum age of the pull request in days before it can be automerged. Default: `0`.

### `blackout-periods`

Periods of time when the action should not run. Multiple periods can be specified as a comma-separated list.
Formats supported:
- Days of week: `Mon,Tue,Wed`
- Time ranges: `9:00-17:00`
- Date ranges: `Dec 24-Jan 5`

### `ignored-dependencies`

Comma-separated list of dependencies to ignore (will not be automerged).
Example: `lodash,express,react`

### `ignored-versions`

Comma-separated list of specific versions to ignore. Format: `package@version`.
Example: `lodash@4.17.21,axios@0.21.1`
You can also use a wildcard to ignore all versions of a specific package: `package@*`

### `semver-filter`

Filter based on semantic versioning level changes.
Comma-separated list of: `major`, `minor`, `patch`. Default: `patch,minor`.

### `merge-method`

The merge method to use when merging pull requests. Default: `merge`.
Possible values: `merge`, `squash`, `rebase`.

## Example usage

Basic example:

```yaml
name: Automerge Dependabot PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  automerge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Automerge Dependabot PRs
        uses: navikt/automerge-dependabot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ github.token }}
          minimum-age-of-pr: '3'
```

Advanced example with all options and github app token::

```yaml
name: Automerge Dependabot PRs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9-17 * * 1-5'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  automerge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v2
        id: app-token
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - name: Automerge Dependabot PRs
        uses: navikt/automerge-dependabot@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
          minimum-age-of-pr: '2'
          blackout-periods: 'Sat,Sun,Dec 24-Jan 5,9:00-10:00'
          ignored-dependencies: 'react,react-dom,webpack'
          ignored-versions: 'eslint@8.0.0,lodash@*'
          semver-filter: 'patch'
          merge-method: 'squash'
```

## How It Works

1. The action identifies open pull requests created by Dependabot
2. It filters pull requests based on:
   - Minimum age requirement
   - Whether it's mergeable (passing checks, no conflicts)
   - Not in blackout period
   - Not an ignored dependency or version
   - Matches allowed semver change levels
3. Eligible pull requests are automatically merged using the specified merge method
